1. Support hardware version upto version "F".

2. Added new error code for system errors. (Scan unstable detected for lamp/ADC only for version "F" and beyond)

3. Added lock/unlock physical scan button control APIs.

4. Added APIs for users to customize the Bluetooth LE advertising name.

5. Disable the physical device scan button while Bluetooth data is in the transaction.
